# What is ReactJs

ReactJS is a popular JavaScript library that allows developers to build user interfaces (UI) for web applications. It was created by Facebook and was released in 2013. ReactJS is often used in Single Page Applications (SPAs) because it provides a fast and efficient way to update the user interface without having to reload the entire page.

ReactJS uses a component-based architecture that allows developers to build reusable and modular UI elements. A component is a self-contained piece of code that manages its own state and properties. Components can be composed together to form complex UIs.

ReactJS uses a virtual DOM (Document Object Model) which is an in-memory representation of the actual DOM. When changes are made to the virtual DOM, ReactJS updates only the parts of the actual DOM that need to be updated, which results in better performance and faster rendering times.

ReactJS is often used with other libraries and frameworks such as Redux, React Router, and Ant Design to provide additional functionality and enhance the development experience.

# What is Ant-Design

Ant Design is a popular UI (User Interface) library for building web applications. It provides a set of pre-designed and reusable UI components that can be easily integrated into a ReactJS application. Ant Design was created by the Chinese tech company Ant Group and was released in 2015.

Ant Design's components are designed with a modern and minimalist style and are highly customizable. Some of the commonly used components include buttons, input fields, menus, modals, and tables.

Ant Design also provides a set of design principles and guidelines that developers can follow to ensure consistency and a good user experience across their applications. These principles include simplicity, efficiency, and consistency.

Ant Design is highly popular among developers due to its ease of use, extensive documentation, and large community support. It also has a growing ecosystem of tools and plugins that can be used to enhance the development experience, such as Ant Design Pro, a set of pre-built components and templates for building enterprise applications.
